# 🕹️ Simple Text-Based RPG Battle Game

Welcome to a simple yet fun **Text-Based RPG Battle Game** built in Python!

In this game, you play as a warrior fighting a wild Goblin. You'll have to manage your **health**, **mana**, and make smart choices between **attacking**, **healing**, or **casting fireballs** — or simply **run away** if things get tough!

## 📜 Features
- Create a player character with random attack power.
- Battle against a Goblin with random attack damage.
- Player can:
  - **Attack** the enemy with a sword.
  - **Heal** to regain health using mana.
  - **Cast Fireball** for heavy damage (costs more mana).
  - **Run away** to escape the battle.
- Turn-based combat with health and mana tracking.
- Input validation to prevent invalid actions.
